# Omniauth::Bokun

This is the unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Bokun. To use it, you'll need to sign up for Bokun account and set up an application in their developer portal to get your API key and secret. [Bokun.io](https://www.bokun.io/)

* This is an in development version of the gem, and it may not be fully functional yet.
TODO: Add tests
TODO: Make scopes configurable

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-bokun'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-bokun

## Usage

The gem expect three environment variables to be set:
- `BOKUN_ID`: Your Bokun application API key (Client ID)
- `BOKUN_SECRET`: Your Bokun application secret key (Client Secret)
- `BOKUN_REDIRECT_DOMAIN`: The URL where Bokun will redirect after authentication. Since Bokun assigns a dynamic domain based on your company name, you need to set this in order for the callback to work.


# If using without Devise
``` ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :bokun, ENV['BOKUN_ID'], ENV['BOKUN_SECRET']
end
```

# If using with Devise

In your `config/initializers/devise.rb`, add the following:

```ruby
config.omniauth :bokun, ENV['BOKUN_ID'], ENV['BOKUN_SECRET']
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
